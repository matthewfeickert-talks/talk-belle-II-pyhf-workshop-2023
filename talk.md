# Summary

.huge[
- Have a runnable environment for AGC at BNL AF (ðŸš€)
- BNL team is working to make drop-in with custom images well specified and easy
- Things work, but to understand how scaling is working will need to improve the monitoring story
   - Currently don't have Dask dashboards detecting the Dask cluster
- Also need to try other AGC analyses and expand / modify environment
