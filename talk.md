# Introduction and Overview

.huge[
* Most of this talk is just walking you through the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/scikit-hep/pyhf) ‚≠ê and the [developer webpage](https://scikit-hep.org/pyhf/development.html) üìñ
* Want to stress that .bold[contributions do not have to be code]!
   - Questions
   - Documentation improvement
   - Contributing to roadmap discussions
* Contributions of all kinds are welcome and additional maintainers from experiments other than ATLAS would be of interest üëÄ
