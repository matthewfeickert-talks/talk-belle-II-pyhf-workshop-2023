# Introduction and Overview

.huge[
* Most of this talk is just walking you through the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/scikit-hep/pyhf) and the [developer webpage](https://scikit-hep.org/pyhf/development.html)
* Want to stress that .bold[contributions do not have to be code]!
   - Questions
   - Documentation improvement
   - Contributing to roadmap discussions
* Contributions of all kinds are welcome and additional maintainers from experiments other than ATLAS would be of interest (ðŸ‘€)

# Summary

.huge[
- Have a runnable environment for AGC at BNL AF (ðŸš€)
- BNL team is working to make drop-in with custom images well specified and easy
- Things work, but to understand how scaling is working will need to improve the monitoring story
   - Currently don't have Dask dashboards detecting the Dask cluster
- Also need to try other AGC analyses and expand / modify environment
