# GitHub Discussions

.kol-2-5.huge[
- Think "Stack Overflow for pyhf specifically"
- Both asking and answering questions helps a lot!
   - .bold[Asking]: Helps us understand what isn't clear, what is tricky
   - .bold[Answering]: Helping out to build community knowledge

# Summary

.huge[
- Have a runnable environment for AGC at BNL AF (ðŸš€)
- BNL team is working to make drop-in with custom images well specified and easy
- Things work, but to understand how scaling is working will need to improve the monitoring story
   - Currently don't have Dask dashboards detecting the Dask cluster
- Also need to try other AGC analyses and expand / modify environment
